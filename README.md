## MTG Cube card downloader

## Prerequisites
 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
 * [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/)

## Usage

Clone this repository into a local folder and save your cube file as cube.txt.

### Installation

```sh
npm install
```

### Running the program
```sh
npm start
```

After that all the cards should be inside the `cards` folder.
There will also be a `with_border` folder with all the same cards but with an added black border (this is good for printing the cards as it usually involves a bleeding area)
